Showcasing Machine Learning Algorithms

# Classification
Using Logistic Regression to classify a dataset using input.txt and labels.txt.
- The model was trained using Jupyter Notebook then saved using joblib
- We them call the model in run.py.
- The accuracy of the model created was found to be 71%

# Clustering
Using a Kmeans Algorithm written from scratch to perform image colour segmentation/image compression.
-  Load an image into your editor as a 3D matrix (the third dimension should have three values, for the red, green and blue values of each pixel). This was done using imread()
- Run the algorithm for k = 2, 4, 8. 16, 32 nd 64, noting that increasing the number of clusters leads to the image produced looking more like the original.
